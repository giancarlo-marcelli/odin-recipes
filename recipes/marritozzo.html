            <li>2 1/2 cup (325 grams) bread flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1/2 cup whole milk warmed but not hot</li>
            <li>1/3 cup white granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (60mls) extra virgin olive oil light flavored</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste</li>
            <li>Finely grated zest of 1 orange</li>
            <li>Finely grated zest of 1 lemon</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon fine salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 water</li>
            <li>2 cups (480mls) heavy whipping cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together flour and yeast then stir in warm milk. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow it to stand at room temperature for 60 minutes. It will rise and then fall back on itself. It should have a pleasant yeasty smell.</li>
            <li>In the large bowl of a stand mixer combine the sponge, eggs, granulated sugar, olive oil, honey, orange zest, lemon zest and vanilla paste. Beat with a flat beater on low speed until well combined.</li>
            <li>Add all but ½ cup of the flour and beat on low. Increase the speed to medium and beat for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Scrape the sides and the bottom of the bowl with a spatula to ensure all of the dough is combined. Then switch to a dough hook. Add the remaining flour and the salt then knead on low speed for 5 more minutes until the dough is soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Oil your work surface with a little olive oil. Scrape the dough onto the oiled surface. Oil your hands as well. Flatten the dough into an oblong shape then fold in half. Turn the dough 90º then repeat the flattening and folding. Fold 6 times including the first folding. Form into a ball.</li>
            <li>Clean out the stand mixer bowl or use another bowl and rub it with a little oil. Place the dough into the bowl and turn it over to coat with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise for 2 hours until almost tripled.</li>
            <li>Divide the maritozzi dough into 8 equal portions. Shape each portion into a slightly elongated, oval shape by folding the outside edges of the dough into the middle. Then place it onto lined baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Spray the tops of the dough lightly with cooking spray and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Allow to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF/180ºC.</li>
            <li>Brush the maritozzi buns with egg wash and bake for 12-14 minutes or until the loaves are dark, golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven. Brush with syrup and return to the oven for 1 or 2 minutes to set the syrup.</li>
            <li>Cool on a wire rack.</li>
            <li>Use a serrated knife to make a cut in the bun either vertical or not quite horizontal. Don't cut all the way through. It should be like a hot dog bun.</li>
            <li>Open the maritozzi buns as wide as you can without splitting them and pipe or spoon the whipped cream in generously.</li>
            <li>Smooth off with a dinner knife or spatula. Dust with powdered sugar if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve maritozzi immediately or refrigerate for up to 6 hours. If refrigerated, remove 10 minutes before serving to allow the bun to soften.</li>
            <li>Heat sugar and water and stir until sugar is dissolved. Then boil for 2 minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Pour the cream into the bowl of an electric stand mixer or a large bowl if you're using a electric hand mixer. Using a whisk attachment begin to whisk slowly increasing the speed gradually. Whisk until stiff peaks form. Take care not to overwhip or you'll end up with butter. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
        </ol>
